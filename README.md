# **PILes**
PIL wrapper to draw complex geometric shapes

![Example](https://github.com/Sylvain-Deposit/PILes/blob/main/docs/title_1.jpg)

4 small modules:

### Distributions, to draw complex distributions in 2D such as sunflower, spirals, parametric curves, etc...

### Functions, to create weights that will be applied to size, alpha, contour width...

### ColorPiles, to easily generate complex color palettes

And combine all of that in a PIL extension to draw multiple shapes in a canvas:

Module allows to draw shapes at desired points, lines and other images as well. Modify their attributes according to axis, distances to centre, etc...
